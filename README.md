# Wine Quality Analysis & Recommendation

This project explores the chemical characteristics of wine and their impact on wine quality through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and builds a simple wine recommendation system using cosine similarity.

## Project Goals

- Analyze how chemical features like alcohol, volatile acidity, and chlorides affect wine quality.
- Build a content-based recommendation system to find wines with similar chemical profiles.

## Methods

- Exploratory Data Analysis: distributions, boxplots, correlations.
- Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`.
- Cosine similarity to measure wine similarity.
